                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                    <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>To make this carrot cake, you’ll start by mixing up your dry ingredients.  One important thing when measuring out your dry ingredients is to make sure to spoon and level your flour</li>
                    <li>You want to avoid packing the flour into the measuring cup, otherwise, you’ll end up with too much in your recipe.  Or if you have a food scale, you can also weigh your ingredients to get an accurate measurement.</li>
                    <li>I also really love some spice in my carrot cake so I use some ground cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.  All three spices add such a wonderful flavor to this cake, but aren’t too overpowering.  They really take this cake from good to absolutely amazing, trust me.</li>
                    <li>For the wet ingredients, you’ll be using some oil, eggs, vanilla, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and applesauce.  The amount of oil and applesauce in this recipe adds the perfect amount of moisture, so you end up with a moist cake that isn’t oily.</li>
                    <li>As always, I use a bit more brown sugar than granulated sugar because it adds more moisture and flavor to this carrot cake.  And of course, you’ll also be mixing in some grated carrots.  I don’t like to skimp on the carrots when it comes to this recipe, so I use 3 cups of grated carrots.</li>
                    <li>I know some carrot cake recipes call for raisins or nuts, but I prefer to leave them out because I know that not everyone is a fan of them.  However, if you love either one (or both!) feel free to mix some into the batter.</li>
                    <li>Then it’s all topped off with my favorite cream cheese frosting.  Have you tried it yet?!  It’s so good and a few of you have already made it and loved it.  The store-bought frosting doesn’t even compare to this homemade frosting recipe.</li>
                    <li>And speaking of the frosting, it makes enough to frost the carrot cake like you see in the pictures.  If you really love frosting, then I suggest making a bit more.  Enjoy!</li>
