    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Potatoes:
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Pierce each potato several times with a knife.</li>
                <li>Place potatoes directly on the oven rack. Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until fork tender.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and allow the potatoes to cool long enough to handle, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/4-inch intact.</li>
                <li>Set the oven to broil.</li>
                <li>Line the potatoes on a baking sheet skin side up. Brush each potato with melted butter. Turn the potatoes over and brush the innards with melted butter and season each potato with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Flip the potatoes over and broil skin side up for 1 minute. Using tongs, flip the potatoes over and broil flesh side up for one minute.</li>
                <li>Remove the potatoes from the oven. Add a sprinkle of cheese to each potato.. Top with chicken fajita mixture and an extra pinch of cheese. Place the potatoes under the broiler for 2-3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Chicken Fajita Stuffing
            <ol>
                <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Season each side of the chicken breast with 1 teaspoon of taco seasoning and a generous pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Place the chicken in the hot skillet. Cook on each side for 6-7 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Remove the skillet from the pan and turn the heat down to medium-low.</li>
                <li>Add remaining oil to the pan. Once the oil is heated, add the chopped peppers and onions. Sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt and add the remaining 2 teaspoons of taco seasoning. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the peppers are tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the peppers are cooking, chop the chicken into small pieces.</li>
                <li>Take the pan off the heat and stir in the chopped chicken. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
